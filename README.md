*Braidwell Consulting Workforce Insight: HR Metrics Analysis*


High attrition isn’t just a number—it’s a signal of underlying structural flaws.

PROJECT REPORT: Optimizing Workforce Retention and Equity through Data Analytics
Workforce instability is often a symptom of deeper organizational misalignment. Braidwell Consulting, a rapidly growing firm in Nigeria, faced rising concerns regarding employee retention, promotion fairness, and salary compliance. Using the IBM HR Analytics dataset, I conducted a full-scale internal audit to uncover the root causes of attrition and identify disparities in compensation and career progression. The analysis revealed critical compliance risks—specifically regarding minimum wage—and paradoxes in gender equity that required immediate strategic intervention.

Aim:
To analyze workforce data to diagnose the drivers of high attrition, evaluate the fairness of the compensation structure, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve retention and organizational equity.

Objectives:
1. Analyze Workforce Composition: Determine gender distribution and role suitability across departments. 
2. Evaluate Compensation Fairness: Investigate gender pay gaps and compliance with minimum salary regulations. 
3. Assess Performance Alignment: Determine if top performers are fairly compensated and promoted. 
4. Identify Attrition Drivers: Uncover patterns in turnover based on department, gender, and salary.

Research Questions
1. Is there a significant gender pay gap or promotion bias within the organization? 
2. Are employees being paid in compliance with the required minimum salary standards? 
3. Which departments and demographics are most susceptible to attrition and why? 
4. Do performance ratings correlate with salary increments and career progression? 

Data Collection:
The analysis utilized the IBM HR Analytics dataset, which includes key fields such as Age, Gender, Monthly Income, Job Role, Years at Company, and Attrition status .

Data Analysis:
The data was cleaned and transformed using Excel and Power BI.  I analysed with SQL. I created interactive dashboards to visualize workforce demographics, salary distributions, and attrition trends, using slicers to filter by Department and Gender.

Findings & Insights
The initial hypothesis suggested standard retention issues, but the data revealed more specific structural challenges.


The Minimum Wage Compliance Crisis: The most alarming finding was financial compliance. Approximately 77.35% of employees earn below the required minimum monthly salary of ₦9,000. This creates a massive compliance risk and is likely a primary driver of dissatisfaction among entry-to-mid-level staff.


The Gender Gap Paradox: While concerns existed regarding a pay gap against women, the data showed that females actually earn slightly more on average (₦6,626) compared to males (₦6,320). However, a different disparity emerged in career progression: Males are promoted more frequently than females. This suggests that while women are hired at decent rates, they face a "glass ceiling" in promotion velocity compared to their male counterparts.


Workforce Segregation: Departments show distinct gender lines. Research & Development is heavily male-dominated, while Human Resources is largely female-dominated. Technical roles like Research Scientists skew male, likely due to role suitability, whereas Sales and HR roles skew female.


Attrition is Talent-Specific: The overall attrition rate stands at 16.12%. However, looking deeper, attrition is not random. It is higher among females and significantly impacts Research & Development. Crucially, low earners who are mid-to-high performers are leaving the company, indicating that high-potential employees are exiting due to a lack of financial recognition.


Performance vs. Tenure Misalignment: Tenure does not guarantee competence. Data showed that longer years at the company did not always correlate with higher performance ratings, yet promotions often favored tenure over performance. Top performers (Rating 4) were generally paid higher, but a concerning number still fell below the minimum wage threshold.


Recommendations
Immediate Salary Structure Overhaul: Implement a salary audit to immediately adjust the 77% of salaries currently below the legal minimum threshold. Introduce structured pay bands (e.g., ₦10,000 increments) tied to job roles rather than arbitrary metrics.


Performance-Based Incentivization: Shift from tenure-based to performance-based rewards. Link salary increments and bonuses directly to Performance Ratings to retain high-performing talent who are currently underpaid and exiting the firm.


Equitable Promotion Framework: Address the promotion gap where males are favored. Establish transparent promotion criteria and ensure gender-balanced panels during review cycles to ensure women have equal upward mobility.


Targeted Retention Strategies: Launch exit interviews specifically for R&D staff and female employees to gather qualitative data. Offer career development paths and retention bonuses specifically for high-performers identified as flight risks.


Conclusion
This project highlights that Braidwell Consulting's retention issues are deeply rooted in compensation compliance and structural promotion biases. The loss of high-performing talent due to low wages poses a significant threat to growth. By correcting the minimum wage disparity and shifting to a meritocratic promotion system, Braidwell can transform its HR data from a warning signal into a roadmap for a fair, high-performance culture.
